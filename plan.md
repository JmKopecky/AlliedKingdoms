# Plan

Factions system that encourages building actual castles and structures rather than obsidian boxes.

# Basic factions elements
* Each user can be a part of a kingdom, either by creating or joining one.
* Kingdoms can have metadata (Titles, short taglines).
* Kingdoms can claim some limited amount of territory.
    * Determine how this territory is reasonably limited.
    * Determine rules for others entering and breaking/using that territory, both for peaceful and hostile kingdoms.

# Faction hierarchy
* Start off merely with owner/king and member.
* Owners cannot leave their own kingdom unless they delete it.
* Members can leave at will.
* Owners can invite and banish members at will.

# Allies


# Wars & Raiding
* Kingdoms must be able to opt out of wars and raiding. This means they cannot attack others but they cannot be attacked.


# Needed commands
* ~~Create kingdom~~
* ~~Delete kingdom~~
* ~~View kingdom info~~
* ~~Claim Land~~
* ~~Unclaim Land~~
* ~~Kingdom Throne TP~~
* Rename kingdom
* Set kingdom tagline
* Invite member to kingdom
* Banish member from kingdom
* Leave kingdom (if member, not owner)
* Set kingdom hostility state (cooldown between changing)



# Notes
* H2 embedded database for data storage, or mysql
